This guide will show you how to create a USSD Loan software in django.

## Prerequisites

- Django installed on your system.

## Steps

1. Create a new Django project:
```python

django-admin startproject <project_name>

```

2. Create a new app within your Django project:
```python

python manage.py startapp <app_name>

```

3. Build your USSD code, including:

- Defining your USSD menu structure and actions to be taken when users select options.
  - use the structure here "*347*505#
- Creating a view to handle incoming USSD requests and process them according to your menu structure.
- Writing code to handle user input and perform the actions specified in your menu structure.
  - for the first option <br />
      To decide a user's loan eligibility, you would need two things: an algorithm and the necessary data. The algorithm would be a set of steps or instructions that would be followed to determine whether the user is eligible for a loan or not. This could include factors such as the user's credit score, income, outstanding debts, and other financial information.

  The data that would be needed to run the algorithm would include the user's personal and financial information, such as their credit score, income, outstanding debts, and other relevant details. This data would be used by the algorithm to make a decision about the user's loan eligibility.

  In general, the loan eligibility algorithm would take into account the user's creditworthiness and financial stability, as well as the lender's own criteria for granting loans, to determine whether the user is eligible for a loan. This decision would be based on a combination of the user's credit score, income, outstanding debts, and other factors that are relevant to the lender. <br />
  
  when you're done with the eligibility, you'll provide what you used in deciding the eligibility.
- Testing your USSD code to ensure it is functioning correctly.

4. Deploy your Django project to render.com.
